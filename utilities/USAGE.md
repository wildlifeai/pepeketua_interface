## To use this app, you need to upload an excel sheet with frog sightings, and the corresponding pictures.
### Excel Sheet:
The sheet must contain *at minimum* the columns:
- `Grid`- Containing the grid of the frog. Each row must have a value from the following options: `["Grid A", "Grid B", "Grid C", "Grid D", "Pukeokahu Frog Monitoring"]`
- `filepath`- This column must contain the name of, or path to, the images you are uploading. In other words, if I am uploading the image `1100-158.jpg`, then the corresponding `filepath` entry must end with that file name. For example, `Grid A/Individual Frogs/81/1100-158.jpg`, or just `1100-158.jpg`.

### Images
Make sure that for every image you upload, there is a corresponding row with the correct Grid and filename columns. If there is a difference, then rename the file or the `filename` column for the correct row. Make sure that row has the correct Grid name, otherwise it won't be compared to the correct images.
